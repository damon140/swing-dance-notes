## Other Resources

There are a lot of big apple video clips, here is a short roundup of the ones I find useful.

* The [original clip that everybody is trying to imitate is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfgKMfexdPQ)
* For dancers [this fixed clip of the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmJ3aYozGMk)
([fixing blog post is here](https://blog.straycat.me.uk/2018/10/fixing-the-apple/)).
* This more [contemporary renditionn from 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQrCtP7zUeo) shows how this dance is typically danced at events that I might go to, including many famous swing dancing teachers.
* The fabulous [Harlem Hot Shots]()
[dance the big apple in a more reconstructive style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E37mb1QROIw) although the song isn't the one that I'm used to.
* The breakdown video serious of every step, with instructions, from both the sides, that everybody refers to is the
[Patric and Natasha Big Apple Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C444gS8IcIk).


The 
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_(dance))
has lots of interesting background, but doesn't help you dance the routine very much!

FIXME: damon needs a reference to ring dances and called big apple and African dancers.
