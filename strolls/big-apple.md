## Historic Video Clips

There are a lot of big apple video clips, here is a short roundup of the ones I find useful.

The [original clip from 1939 that everybody is trying to imitate is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfgKMfexdPQ).  It is from the movie [Keep Punching](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0135501/) and danced by [Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]().

For dancers [this sound synchronisation fixed clip of the original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmJ3aYozGMk)
([fixing blog post is here](https://blog.straycat.me.uk/2018/10/fixing-the-apple/)) is very useful.

[This clip from 1959/ 1960 television](https://youtu.be/rmDe2hn7vGg) features Al Mins and Leon x from the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers clip from 19xx.  They explain then dance the first half with amazing style.

## Contemporary Video Clips

This more [contemporary rendition from 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQrCtP7zUeo) shows how this dance is typically danced at events that I might go to, including many famous swing dancing teachers.

The fabulous [Harlem Hot Shots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Shots_(dance_companies)#Harlem_Hot_Shots)
[dance the big apple in a more recreation style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E37mb1QROIw) although the song isn't the one that I'm used to, and it starts after the shouts.

## Lesson Video Clips

The breakdown video serious of every step, with instructions, from both the sides, that everybody refers to is the
[Patric and Natasha Big Apple Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C444gS8IcIk).

## Other resources

The  [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_(dance))
has lots of interesting background, but doesn't help you dance the routine very much!

FIXME: damon needs a reference to ring dances and called big apple and African dancers.
