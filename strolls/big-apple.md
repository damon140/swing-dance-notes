but for dancers [this fixed clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmJ3aYozGMk)
([fixing here](https://blog.straycat.me.uk/2018/10/fixing-the-apple/)).


There is a sound synched version of this clip, TODO: link here.

I like to watch the Harlem Hot Shots
[dance the big apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E37mb1QROIw) in this clip when I need help remembering
different parts, although it doesn't start with shouts and uses a different song than I'm used to.

The famous video breakdown videos that everybody refers to are the
[Patric and Natasha Big Apple Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C444gS8IcIk).

The 
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_(dance))
has lots of interesting background, but doesn't help you dance the routine very much!
