# Big Apple

I was unsatisfied with findable internet resources about the Big Apple steps, so I made this page describing the steps
as I understand them, in a table format.

The 
[original clip that everybody is trying to imitate is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfgKMfexdPQ).

I like to watch the Harlem Hot Shots
[dance the big apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E37mb1QROIw) in this clip when I need help remembering
different parts, although it doesn't start with shouts and uses a different song than I'm used to.

The famous video breakdown videos that everybody refers to are the
[Patric and Natasha Big Apple Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C444gS8IcIk).

The 
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple_(dance))
has lots of interesting background, but doesn't help you dance the routine very much!
